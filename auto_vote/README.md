This folder contains code use to automatically interact with a webpage and vote for a given option.

This project was done inspired on the guide found [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/how-to-automate-filling-in-web-forms-with-python-using-selenium/) and adding some other functions like `find_elements_by_xpath` when finding the disired element to make the project more interesting.
